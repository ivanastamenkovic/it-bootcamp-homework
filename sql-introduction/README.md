# sql-introduction
This repository contains homework assignments from a QA (manual and automation software testing) course.

## Important Note

The database in this repository is in **Serbian**. The SQL file `preduzece_ddl.sql` contains tables with names and columns written in Serbian. Although the homework assignments are translated into English, the tables themselves remain in Serbian.

- The word "preduzeÄ‡e" in Serbian translates to "company" or "enterprise" in English.
